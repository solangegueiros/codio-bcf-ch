In a Merkle Tree, leaf nodes contain hashes of data blocks (not the actual data), and each non-leaf node is the hash of its child nodes' hashes. \n\nThe other options are incorrect: A Merkle Tree is a Tree data structure, and not a linked list. Nodes in a Merkle Tree do not contain both data and hashes (only leaf nodes contain data hashes, while parent nodes contain hashes of their child node hashes).",
