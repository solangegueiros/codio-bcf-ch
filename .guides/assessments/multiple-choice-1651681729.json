		"guidance": "The correct answer is \"A vote initiated on the Ethereum triggers protocol changes on another blockchain.\". This scenario demonstrates cross-chain governance as it involves a decision made on one blockchain (Ethereum) directly affecting operations on a different blockchain. This exemplifies true interoperability in DAO governance across multiple chains. \n\nThe other options do not necessarily involve cross-chain interactions: conducting voting on a single network, using multiple wallets, storing funds across chains, or using off-chain voting can all occur without true cross-chain governance implementation. This question tests the student's understanding of how DAOs can leverage blockchain interoperability to extend their governance capabilities across different networks.",
