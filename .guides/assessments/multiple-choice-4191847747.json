This accurately reflects the process described in the topic, where users need to connect their wallet, accept the Chainlink Foundation Terms of Service, and verify their identity using a GitHub account to protect against spam requests. \n\nThe other options are incorrect: there are limits on the amount of Sepolia ETH you can receive, the faucet can distribute both Sepolia ETH and Sepolia LINK, and you need to use a testnet-compatible wallet address, not a regular Ethereum address.",
