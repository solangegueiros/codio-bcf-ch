Consensus mechanisms are based on game theory.

### Consensus mechanisms in Blockchain

Consensus mechanisms are the protocols that all participants in a blockchain network follow to maintain the integrity, security, and smooth operation of the blockchain. They ensure that all nodes in the network agree on the state of the blockchain, preventing fraud and errors.

A Byzantine fault (also Byzantine generals problem, interactive consistency, source congruency, error avalanche, Byzantine agreement problem, and Byzantine failure) is a condition of a computer system, particularly [distributed computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed\_computing) systems, where components may fail and there is imperfect information on whether a component has failed. The term takes its name from an [allegory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory), the "Byzantine generals problem", developed to describe a situation in which, to avoid catastrophic failure of the system, the system's actors must agree on a concerted strategy, but some of these actors are unreliable.

Some consensus types used in Blockchains:

* Proof of Work (PoW)  
* Proof of Stake (PoS)  
* Proof of Authority (PoA)
