## Distributed Networks

Peer-to-peer (P2P) computing or networking is a distributed application architecture that partitions tasks or workloads between peers.

The diagrams of Paul Baran, published in the text On distributed communications (BARAN, Paul \- 1964\) are one of the best ways to present distributed networks:

This is the basic concept of Blockchain: p2p, peer to peer or peer to peer networks, where communication can be carried out between any pair of computers.

### Centralized Networks 

A system where a single, centrally owned or controlled server (or node) is entrusted with processing data to and  from peripheral nodes. This can be diagrammed similarly to a wheel where a single node acts as an axil that sends messages of the "spokes" to the outside of the wheel.

### Decentralized Networks

Peer-to-peer networks, where no entity controls an effective or controlling number of the network nodes, running [open source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open\_source\_software) also not controlled by any entity, are said to effect a decentralized network protocol. These networks are harder for outside actors to shut down, as they have no central headquarters

### Distributed Networks

A network configuration where every participant can communicate with one another without going through a centralized point. Since there are multiple pathways for communication, the loss of any participant will not prevent communication. This is also known as peer-to-peer network as they're decentralized.
