# Ethereum Blockchain

## Introduction to Ethereum and Smart Contracts

Imagine a digital world where contracts execute themselves, applications run without central servers, and financial transactions happen seamlessly without intermediaries. This is the vision of Ethereum, a groundbreaking platform that has revolutionized the blockchain space since its launch in 2015 by Vitalik Buterin and a group of co-founders. 

The Ethereum blockchain is a decentralized, open-source blockchain platform that enables developers to build and deploy smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps).

Ethereum extends the capabilities of blockchain technology beyond what was initially possible with Bitcoin, enabling programmable, self-executing contracts that automatically enforce agreements.

Ethereum has become a cornerstone of the decentralized digital landscape, enabling innovative applications and transforming industries.

From [https://ethereum.org/](https://ethereum.org/):   
Ethereum is a network of computers all over the world that follow a set of rules called the Ethereum protocol. The Ethereum network acts as the foundation for communities, applications, organizations and digital assets that anyone can build and use.  
Ethereum is the community-run technology powering the cryptocurrency ether (ETH) and thousands of decentralized applications.  
Ethereum is not controlled by any particular entity. It exists whenever there are connected computers running software following the Ethereum protocol and adding to the Ethereum blockchain. Each of these computers is known as a node. Nodes can be run by anyone.

## Nick Szabo and his role in Smart Contracts history

Nick Szabo, a computer scientist, legal scholar, and cryptographer, is widely recognized as the father of smart contracts. His groundbreaking work in the 1990s laid the foundation for what would become a crucial element of blockchain technology.

### The Birth of Smart Contracts

In 1994, Szabo first proposed the concept of smart contracts, defining them as digital protocols that enable information transfer using mathematical algorithms to execute transactions and establish secure connections over computer networks. His vision was to bring the “highly evolved” practices of contract law and practice to the design of electronic commerce protocols between strangers on the Internet.

Key aspects of Szabo’s smart contract concept:

* Automation of contractual clauses  
* Reduction of transaction costs  
* Elimination of the need for trusted intermediaries  
* Enhanced security through cryptography

### From Concept to Reality

While Szabo’s initial proposal was ahead of its time, the technology needed to fully implement smart contracts didn’t exist in the 1990s. It wasn’t until the advent of blockchain technology, particularly with the launch of Ethereum in 2015, that smart contracts became a practical reality.
