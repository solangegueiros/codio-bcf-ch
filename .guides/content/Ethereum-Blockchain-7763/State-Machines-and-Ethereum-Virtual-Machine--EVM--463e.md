## State Machines and Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)

### State Machines

The finite-state machine (FSM) can change from one state to another in response to some inputs; the change from one state to another is called a transition.  
A state machine is a behavior model. It consists of a finite number of states and is therefore also called FSM. Based on the current state and a given input the machine performs state transitions and produces outputs.

Transactions Produce outputs from state 1 to state 2

### Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)

The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is a decentralized virtual environment that executes code consistently and securely across all Ethereum nodes. Nodes run the EVM to execute smart contracts, using "gas" to measure the computational effort required for operations, ensuring efficient resource allocation and network security. It acts as a decentralized computer that runs on the network's nodes.

The EVM enables developers to write decentralized applications in various programming languages, most notably Solidity, and ensures that smart contracts execute consistently across all nodes.
