The provable method to establish trust in a transaction.  
Cryptography is the study of the principles and techniques by which information can be transformed from its original form to a form that is not human readable.

* Information can be known only to its recipient (holder of the "secret key")  
* Difficult to read by an unauthorized person  
* Only the recipient of the message can read the information easily

It is a branch of mathematics, part of cryptology.

Modern cryptography is fundamental to aspects of information security:

* confidentiality  
* data integrity  
* authentication  
* non-repudiation
