### Proof of Stake (PoS)

Proof of Stake provides an alternative to PoW in the application of consensus algorithms and the security of the blockchain.

* Known as proof of participation  
* To participate in the validation, the amount of coins that the validator has is used, instead of the computational power  
* The validator must place his deposited coins in a kind of safe to "prove" his participation, without moving the coins  
* The more coins you have, the greater the chance of validating transactions and earning from them  
* In terms of energy, it is more economical than PoW  
* It should bring more security and decentralization, but it makes larger coin holders more likely to get more coins.
